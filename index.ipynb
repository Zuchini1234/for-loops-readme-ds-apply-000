    "Programming is all about making things my dynamic and more efficient, right? Well a big part of making our code more efficient and dynamic are loops! They allow us to iterate over each element in a collection, like a list. Perhaps we could already do that by writing out a line of code for each element in the collection, but that wouldn't be very efficient, would it? No, not at all. With loops, we can write one line of code that operates on each element in a collection. Pretty cool, right? Let's get started!"

The second argument is the collection we are iterating over, or in this case, the list `zero_to_three`.\n",

So, if all we want to do is print each element, then the line that prints the element is our block. Our block is indicated by indenting. So the first line after the colon `:` should be indented. When we want to end our block, we simply stop indenting. Any code follwing the for loop will only be executed after the for loop finishes.\n",
